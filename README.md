# Feline

This is a Ruby command line utility that interacts with a couple of Cat-related APIs


## Installation

You may need to install bundler:

    $ gem install bundler


And then the dependencies:

    $ bundle


## Usage

  Open a web browser with a random cat image:

    $ ./bin/feline browser

  Print a random cat fact to the terminal:

    $ ./bin/feline fact

  Save a random cat image to the desktop (on Mac OS):
